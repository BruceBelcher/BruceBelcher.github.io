        Hello, I'm Bruce Belcher.
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Welcome to my Portfolio. Please don't judge too harshly!<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The projects are learning excercises, not meant as 'production' code,
        so you'll be able to find bugs quite easily.<br>
        <br>
        I'll be adding new projects and (hopefully) improving the website over time,
        so please keep returning to see how I'm progressing.<br>
        <br>
