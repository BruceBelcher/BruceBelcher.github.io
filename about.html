            <h1>About Me - a quick summary</h1>
            <h2>As my circumstances are not usual, hereâ€™s an overview of my experience:</h2>
            <ul>  
                <li>I took voluntary redundancy from a career as a major account sales 
                    executive with IBM in 2012.</li>
                <li>My wife is a Partner in a law firm so it made sense for me to take on 
                    looking after our daughter.</li>
                <li>I have taken various jobs since then, but I had to work around my 
                    child care duties.</li>
                <li>This culminated in taking the CodeNation course, which reminded me 
                    how much I enjoyed coding.</li>
                <li>I was not able to pursue a job at that time due to child care 
                    (it was the summer holidays) and she had started at high school.</li>
                <li>Following this, we all know what happens in 2020!</li>
            </ul>  
            <h3>I have significant programming experience (inc. SQL) from my degree in 
                computer science and programming and analyst roles held over a long career in IT. 
                This experience means I am confident in quickly picking up most 
                programming languages. <br>
                <br>
                I have less experience coding the user interface (HTML/CSS) - it's a brave new world! - 
                but I'm learning fast.<br>
                <br>
                I also have experience in major account sales and account management skills, office administraion,
                teaching and coaching and working with people with learning challenges.
