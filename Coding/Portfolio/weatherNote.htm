        Weather Forecast Application<br>
        <br>
        Written using node.JS, (JavaScript on the server) and express,
        (to build web applications and communicate through browser).<br>
        <br>
        Utilises 2 API calls, 1st to mapbox which returns the lat and long of the location specified
        and 2nd to darksky to get the forecast for that location.<br>
        <br>
        It's a node.JS application so 'hosted' on heroku in order to run it from my Portfolio.<br>
        To run locally, cd to the application directory and call 'node app.js'. Result on localhost:3002.<br>
        To run publicly, from the Portfolio web site, call https://afternoon-stream-66915.herokuapp.com/<br>
        To upgrade and upload to heroku; cd to application directory and make changes.
