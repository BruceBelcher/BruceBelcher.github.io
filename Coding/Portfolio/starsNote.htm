        Flying Star Field<br><br>
        Inspired by a screeen saver I had in the 1990's!<br>
        Project using 'canvas' and 'requestanimationFrame' to create<br>
        the effect of flying through stars. Had to think of 'fixes' to get over<br>
        limitations of canvas but it works well (I think).
