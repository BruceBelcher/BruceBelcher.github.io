        <h1>This is all about me</h1>
    <p>As my circumstances are not usual, hereâ€™s an overview of my experience:</p>
    <ul>  
        <li>I took voluntary redundancy from a career as a major account sales executive with IBM in 2012.</li>
        <li>My wife is a Partner in a law firm so it made sense for me to take on looking after our daughter.</li>
        <li>I have taken various jobs since then, but all needed to allow me to work around my child care duties.</li>
        <li>This culminated in taking the CodeNation course, which reminded me how much I enjoyed coding.</li>
        <li>I was not able to pursue a job at that time due to child care (it was the summer holidays) and she had started at high school.</li>
        <li>Following this, we all know what happens in 2020!</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>I have significant programming experience (inc. SQL) from my degree in computer science and programming jobs held prior to joining IBM. This experience means I am confident in quickly picking up most programming languages. It may also be worth drawing your attention to my experience in sales and account management as this may increase the opportunities available.  As the only experience I have in front end programming (HTML/CSS) is from my course with CodeNation, this would be my weak area, although my programming experience is applicable. 
    </p>
    <p>Whilst the time needed for child care is now much reduced, I will still have the major share and some flexibility in any position will be necessary to accommodate this.  I hope this wont be too much of a barrier to putting me forward for roles and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
    </p>
