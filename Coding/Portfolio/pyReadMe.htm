    <h3>
        Python projects are a work in progress.<br>
        <br>
        I'm trying to find how to integrate/run them from an html script.
        There seems to be many ways to do this, using various packages, all seem complicated.
        I started looking at using Django (see Hello-World project), but haven't cracked it yet.<br>
        <br>
        Left as a work in progress as I want to get the website 'published'.
